Description: The function smd.t.test enhances the output of the
        independent groups t-test. This output includes descriptive and
        inferential statistics, including the standardized mean
        difference or Cohen's d. The smd.t.test function also
        introduces the ODDSMD plot, which displays the Overlapping
        Density Distributions of the two groups as well as a visual
        display of the mean difference and Standardized Mean
        Difference. Other functions provide for the t-test from
        descriptive statistics, color plotting, a calibrated power
        curve plotted with colors from one statement, and regression
        analysis from one statement.  To obtain a one statement read
        and initial processing of csv data, use the function rad, for
        Read, Attach and Display. The parallel function out writes the
        csv file. The function help.me provides a help system that
        suggests specific analyses by providing the name of the
        relevant functions for a specific topic.
