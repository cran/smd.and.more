Description: The function smd.t.test enhances the output of the
        independent groups t-test for the analysis of the mean
        difference. This output includes descriptive and inferential
        statistics, including the standardized mean difference or
        Cohen's d. The smd.t.test function also introduces the ODDSMD
        plot, which displays the Overlapping Density Distributions of
        the two groups as well as a visual display of the mean
        difference and Standardized Mean Difference. Other functions
        provide for the t-test from descriptive statistics, color
        plotting, and a quick, calibrated power curve plotted with
        colors.  To obtain a quick, simplified read of csv data, use
        the function rad, for Read, Attach and Display. The function
        help.me provides a help system that suggests specific analyses
        by providing the name of the relevant functions for a specific
        topic.
