        enhanced output for the independent groups t-test for the
        analysis of the mean difference. This output includes
        descriptive statistics, the pooled or within-group standard
        deviation, the standardized mean difference or Cohen's d, and
        an evaluation of assumptions. The output includes an ODDSMD
        plot, which displays the Overlapping Density Distributions of
        the two groups as well as the mean difference and Standardized
        Mean Difference.
